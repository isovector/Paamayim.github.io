Maarja is a woman whose life story sounds exactly like a Dostoevskian wet
dream. She is small and gaunt, with dark, long flowing hair, and eyes that hint
of both jaundice and unimaginable sorrow. She lives her life enslaved -- perhaps
not exactly how you might think a young woman of 24 might be, though probably
not too far from -- to her boyfriend, a man with a wife and child, and other
mistresses besides her.

Maarja and I met on Tinder, and, uncharacteristically of most Estonians
(people?) on Tinder, she messaged me first. When I later asked why, she replied
that nobody ever messaged her, and so she needed to take actions into her own
hands. It was this sense of agency that initially attracted me to her; she liked
that I was from Canada. Maarja has a thing for Canadians.

We made a plan to meet up and see a film. I didn't really care what -- a date
with a beautiful Estonian woman was good enough for me. I told her this, and she
laughed. Derisively. Maarja considers herself stupid and ugly, but neither of
these is true.

. walked around Tartu, seeing some of the sights, but mostly just
getting to know one another. Despite her friendly demeanor, i cold tell this
woman
